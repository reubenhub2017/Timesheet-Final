# Timesheet
Made a Timesheet for ECHO programs with PHP, MYSQL, Javascript, JQuery, HTML and CSS
The application focus on students being able to login their hours with their corresponding school. 
The admin is then able to look those hours with a provided username and password. 
The application was with login data provided by the client
Since the client discontinued the program the credentials are invalid. 
The main interface works including the Javascript, JQuery. PHP however has to be updated to PHP7. However that can be easily fixed with provided documentation. 
There's no application structure at the time such as MVC. However, the Timesheet can be easily be arranged to do 

The main page is provided in the index.php.
# Web Server
The Timesheet was made with wamp at the time, but can accessible with Ampps. 
For viewing the Timesheet folder can be push the Timesheet folder into the /www folder. 
The Timesheet is not deployable since I cannot verify credentials with the client but viewing the website can be obtained.
